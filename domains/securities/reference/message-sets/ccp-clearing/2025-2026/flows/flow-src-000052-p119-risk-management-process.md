# Risk Management process:

Source context: CCP Clearing. This reference preserves the source-defined segment and its evidence.

Purpose, trigger, preconditions and postconditions are not separately established in this extracted segment. The narrative and linked process tables preserve the available evidence.

## Participants

| Source role | Canonical scoped record | Evidence interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CCP | [Participant](../../../../../../../shared/reference/participants/participant-src-000052-ccp.md) | Mentioned in this segment; use the activity/narrative evidence for actions and message direction |

## Ordered activities and source narrative

**P120** Definition: Process or approach that seeks to eliminate or at least minimize the level of risk associated with a business operation. This process encompasses three sub-processes: the netting, the margining and the Default Fund contribution processes.

**P121** Trigger: During the day or at the end of the day, depending on each CCP’s internal rules, each clearing member ‘risk profile is evaluated.

**P122** Pre-conditions: None.

**P123** Post-conditions:  Each Clearing Member may be requested to provide collateral to cover any risk identified.

**P124** Role: CCP

## Messages and alternative paths

Optional, failure, cancellation, reversal and decision paths remain as described in the source narrative and activity rows above. No additional path is inferred from message names or XML containment.

## Limitations and provenance

- Source-delimited draft; visual diagram reconciliation and cross-section flow consolidation remain pending.
- Message family mentions do not identify an exact supplied schema version unless the full identifier is stated.
- Participants listed from narrative mentions are not automatically senders, receivers, or responsible actors.

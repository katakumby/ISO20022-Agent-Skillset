# Settlement Netting process:

Source context: CCP Clearing. This reference preserves the source-defined segment and its evidence.

Purpose, trigger, preconditions and postconditions are not separately established in this extracted segment. The narrative and linked process tables preserve the available evidence.

## Participants

| Source role | Canonical scoped record | Evidence interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CCP | [Participant](../../../../../../../shared/reference/participants/participant-src-000052-ccp.md) | Mentioned in this segment; use the activity/narrative evidence for actions and message direction |

## Ordered activities and source narrative

**P156** Definition: Process by which a CCP takes all trades legs of a CM into account and calculate the net resulting instruction (based on the CCP rules) that should be settled.

**P157** Trigger: The trades netting is completed and, based on the settlement results received from the Central Securities Depository, the CCP updates the positions/instructions (CNS model only). It may also apply the announced corporate events to the impacted positions/instructions (this process is out of scope).

**P158** Pre-conditions: None

**P159** Post-conditions: Settlement Obligation is sent to each Clearing Member.

**P160** Role: CCP

## Messages and alternative paths

Optional, failure, cancellation, reversal and decision paths remain as described in the source narrative and activity rows above. No additional path is inferred from message names or XML containment.

## Limitations and provenance

- Source-delimited draft; visual diagram reconciliation and cross-section flow consolidation remain pending.
- Message family mentions do not identify an exact supplied schema version unless the full identifier is stated.
- Participants listed from narrative mentions are not automatically senders, receivers, or responsible actors.

# PDF table and painted-object reconciliation

Source: [src-000351](../../../../../../../../raw-input/target2securities_t2s/ISO20022_MDR_Target2Securities_August_2026_v1.zip) archive member `ISO20022_MDR_Target2Securities_August_2026_v1/Target2-Securities_CashAccountQueryAndReport_MessageSet/ISO20022_MDRPart2_Target2Securities_CashAccountQueryAndReport_v1.pdf`. All 185 file pages were enumerated, with the registered source checksum verified unchanged. 232 extracted table candidates contain 13173 physical cells. Their complete Markdown cell matrices match the maintained extraction. Independent PDFium bounded cell text matched 13173 cells after Unicode compatibility/whitespace normalization. 0 remaining comparisons differ only by PDFium U+0002 representing a source hyphen; every exact source/cell locator and both strings remain in the audit. No other cell-text difference or uncertain grid mapping was found.

Painted path association is a structural classification, not an individual visual review of every page. Original lexical vector-candidate inventories remain unchanged; unpainted clipping operators do not create visible diagram content.

No painted object remained outside the table-border/fill, link-underline and narrow page-rule templates. This does not assert absence of text-only diagrams or complete business-semantic review.

## Direct visual checks and limits

No page of this publication is claimed as individually visually inspected by this particular audit. The bounded painted geometry and independent cell-text checks cover all its pages, using the separately documented repeated-template rules. The manually inspected template examples include message lists, nested choice tables, code tables, warning panels, text constraints, publisher branding and legal links. Header/row shading and all table borders are retained in originals. This check does not validate business applicability, resolve conflicting definitions, or certify each table layout and every cell by individual visual reading.

# Fund Cash Forecast Reporting / Estimated and Confirmed Reporting  / Estimated

[src-000095](../../../../../../../raw-input/investment_funds/ISO20022_MDRPart1_InvestmentFunds_2025_2026_v2.docx); source heading P322, direct-body paragraph P324.

## Purpose, trigger and common conditions

**P316** This message flow section illustrates the use of the fund cash forecast messages in typical message sequencing scenarios. The fund cash forecast messages are sent by a report provider to the report user.

**P317** The report provider is, for example, a fund accountant, transfer agent, market data provider, or any other interested party.

**P318** The report user is, for example, a fund management company, a transfer agent, market data provider, regulator or any other interested party.

**P319** The difference between estimated and confirmed cash forecast reports is that estimated reports are sent before the cut-off time and/or the price valuation, whereas confirmed cash forecast reports contain definitive prices.

**P320** The difference between detailed and non-detailed cash forecast reports is in the level of information that can be provided. In the detailed reports, the cash flow amounts can be sorted according to pre-defined or user-defined criteria and it is possible to breakdown cash forecast amounts by, for example, investment fund transaction types.

The source-specific trigger, acceptance conditions, outcomes and optional/failure paths are preserved in the ordered narrative below. A separate formal precondition/postcondition is asserted only where the source supplies one.

## Ordered activities and source-defined alternatives

**P323** The report provider sends a FundEstimatedCashForecastReport message to the report user.

## Message definitions and related paths

| Family | Supplied exact definition | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| camt.040 | [camt.040.001.04](../../../../messages/camt.040.001.04/index.md) | Same-set Part2/schema reference; this Part1 flow uses names/families. |


## Outcomes and source qualifications

- Arrow direction and order follow the literal picture. Mermaid uses standard solid arrowheads rather than source open-head geometry; no additional synchrony, timing or network guarantee is inferred.
- Part1 message names/families do not establish exact versions; use maintained Part2/schema references.
- Source bank icons denote named participants, not institutional identity of a functional role. Repeated instructing-party occurrences are distinct parties using the same role definition.

The narrative gives each outcome: execution confirmation, accepted/pending status, reporting/replacement, rejection or cancellation as applicable. These outcomes are not interchanged. For cancellation, CAND concerns completion of the requested cancellation; order acceptance (PACK) does not assert execution.

## Review

Source narrative, participant roles and every depicted message direction were compared with the original picture and Word-rendered page on 2026-11-09. The bounded flow scope is reviewed; referenced schemas and tables retain their own statuses.

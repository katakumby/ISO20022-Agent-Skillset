**P416** This message flow section illustrates the use of the OrderInstructionStatusReport message in typical message sequencing scenarios. The OrderInstructionStatusReport message is sent by the executing party to the instructing party. It is used to inform the instructing party of the status of its order/s or order message.

**P417** There may be one or more intermediaries in the transaction chain.

**P418** Different message flows may exist depending on the service level agreement (SLA). These include: 

**P419** how frequently an order instruction status message must be sent,

**P420** when, and if, an order instruction status message must be sent at a pre-defined time (at cut-off time or once a day) or upon request, 

**P421** which statuses will be sent, for example, 'rejected only', 'received and rejected only’, ‘sent to next party’ and accepted only’.

**P422** The instructing party is, for example, an investment manager. The executing party is, for example, a transfer agent.

**P759** Portfolio Transfer Management

**P760** This message flow section illustrates the use of the portfolio transfer messages in typical message sequencing scenarios. The portfolio transfer instruction and confirmation messages are exchanged between a transferee (new plan manager) and the transferor (old plan manager).

**P761** The PortfolioTransferInstruction message is sent by the transferee and may be accepted or rejected by the transferor. The transferor may report on the status of a PortfolioTransferInstruction message with the TransferInstructionStatusReport message.

**P762** The PortfolioTransferInstruction message may be cancelled by the transferee with the PortfolioTransferCancellationRequest message. The transferor may report on the status of a PortfolioTransferCancellationRequest message with the TransferInstructionStatusReport message.

**P763** The transferee may query the status of a previously sent PortfolioTransferInstruction message with a RequestForTransferStatusReport message.

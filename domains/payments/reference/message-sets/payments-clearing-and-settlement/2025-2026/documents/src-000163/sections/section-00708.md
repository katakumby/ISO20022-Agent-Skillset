7.4.2.40.30.2.3.2  Reference <Ref>
Presence: [0..1]
Definition: Unique reference, as assigned by the creditor, to unambiguously refer to the payment
transaction.
Usage: If available, the initiating party should provide this reference in the structured remittance
information, to enable reconciliation by the creditor upon receipt of the amount of money.
If the business context requires the use of a creditor reference or a payment remit identification, and
only one identifier can be passed through the end-to-end chain, the creditor's reference or payment
remittance identification should be quoted in the end-to-end transaction identification.

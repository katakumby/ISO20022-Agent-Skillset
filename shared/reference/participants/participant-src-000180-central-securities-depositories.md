# Central Securities Depositories

Business context: Post-Trade Matching. Source classification: business role.

## Definition

An infrastructure that, holds or controls, the holding of physical or dematerialised financial instruments belonging to all, or a large portion of, the investors in a securities market. This effects the centralised transfer of ownership of such securities by entries on its books and records. A CSD may also offer additional services such as trade matching or custody.

Evidence: [T7](../../../domains/securities/reference/message-sets/post-trade-matching/2024-2025/documents/src-000180/tables/tbl-0007.md), source row 11.

A functional participant role describes involvement in a relationship or transaction. It is not an assertion that a particular institution always plays that role.

# Central Counterparty

Business context: T2S SecuritiesAndPenaltyReporting. Source classification: business role.

## Definition

An infrastructure that is very often a component of a clearinghouse, and facilitates clearing and settlement for its members by standing between the buyer and the seller of a trade. It may net transactions, and substitutes itself as settlement counterparty to each position.

Evidence: [T6](../../../domains/securities/reference/message-sets/t2s-securities-and-penalty-reporting/march-2026/documents/src-000374/tables/tbl-0006.md), source row 5.

A functional participant role describes involvement in a relationship or transaction. It is not an assertion that a particular institution always plays that role.

## Responsibilities and actions

Responsibilities are described in the definition and linked flows; no separate activity-initiator rows were matched.

## Relationships

| Relationship | Related scoped record | Evidence |

## Flows, source process sections and messages

No flow segment has yet been matched to this role label.

Message families found in these flows: not established. Exact-version applicability requires the linked source locator.

## Aliases, identification and limitations

Source labels: `Central Counterparty`. No external identifier scheme or alias equivalence has been inferred.

- Definition is scoped to this source and message-set context; same labels in other sources remain distinct.
- Aliases and identifier schemes have not been established beyond explicit source labels.
- Narrative-only participants not captured by definition/initiator tables require additional review.

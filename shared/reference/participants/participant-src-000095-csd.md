# CSD

Business context: Investment Funds. Source classification: business role (matrix label; definition not extracted).

## Definition

The source names this actor in an activity or role matrix; a separate definition has not been established. This limitation remains open for review.

A functional participant role describes involvement in a relationship or transaction. It is not an assertion that a particular institution always plays that role.

## Responsibilities and actions

Responsibilities are described in the definition and linked flows; no separate activity-initiator rows were matched.

## Relationships

## Flows, source process sections and messages

No flow segment has yet been matched to this role label.

Message families found in these flows: not established. Exact-version applicability requires the linked source locator.

## Aliases, identification and limitations

Source labels: `CSD`. No external identifier scheme or alias equivalence has been inferred.

- Definition is scoped to this source and message-set context; same labels in other sources remain distinct.
- Aliases and identifier schemes have not been established beyond explicit source labels.
- Narrative-only participants not captured by definition/initiator tables require additional review.

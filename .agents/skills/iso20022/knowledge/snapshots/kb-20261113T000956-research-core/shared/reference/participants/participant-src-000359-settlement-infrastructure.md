# Settlement Infrastructure

Business context: T2S IntraBalanceMovement. Source classification: business role.

## Definition

The party that provides services to its members for the settlement of transactions and holding of assets (e. g.  T2S, RTGS).

Evidence: [T6](../../../domains/securities/reference/message-sets/t2s-intra-balance-movement/march-2024/documents/src-000359/tables/tbl-0006.md), source row 4.

A functional participant role describes involvement in a relationship or transaction. It is not an assertion that a particular institution always plays that role.

## Responsibilities and actions

Responsibilities are described in the definition and linked flows; no separate activity-initiator rows were matched.

## Relationships

| Relationship | Related scoped record | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Can play the functional participant role in this source context | [System Transaction Administrator](participant-src-000359-system-transaction-administrator.md) | [T7](../../../domains/securities/reference/message-sets/t2s-intra-balance-movement/march-2024/documents/src-000359/tables/tbl-0007.md) row 5, column 3 |

## Flows, source process sections and messages

No flow segment has yet been matched to this role label.

Message families found in these flows: not established. Exact-version applicability requires the linked source locator.

## Aliases, identification and limitations

Source labels: `Settlement Infrastructure`. No external identifier scheme or alias equivalence has been inferred.

- Definition is scoped to this source and message-set context; same labels in other sources remain distinct.
- Aliases and identifier schemes have not been established beyond explicit source labels.
- Narrative-only participants not captured by definition/initiator tables require additional review.

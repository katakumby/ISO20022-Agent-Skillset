C18 SupplementaryDataRule
This component may not be used without the explicit approval of a SEG and submission to the
RA of ISO 20022 compliant structure(s) to be used in the Envelope element.
C19 WithLinkageRule
If Code WITH is used, then the one or more instruction which are linked become bound and
which must be executed together. Even if one single transactions/instructions/notifications can
not be executed, then all the other transactions/instructions/notifications must also be kept
pending. Therefore the use of code WITH must be limited to combine up to 2 or 3 transactions/
instructions/notifications.

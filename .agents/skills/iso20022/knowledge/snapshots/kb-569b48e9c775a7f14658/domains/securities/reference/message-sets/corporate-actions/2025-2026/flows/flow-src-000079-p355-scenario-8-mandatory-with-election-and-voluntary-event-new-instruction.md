# Scenario 8: Mandatory with Election and Voluntary Event - New Instruction

Source context: Corporate Actions. This reference preserves the source-defined segment and its evidence.

Purpose, trigger, preconditions and postconditions are not separately established in this extracted segment. The narrative and linked process tables preserve the available evidence.

## Participants

| Source role | Canonical scoped record | Evidence interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account Servicer | [Participant](../../../../../../../shared/reference/participants/participant-src-000079-account-servicer.md) | Mentioned in this segment; use the activity/narrative evidence for actions and message direction |
| Account Owner | [Participant](../../../../../../../shared/reference/participants/participant-src-000079-account-owner.md) | Mentioned in this segment; use the activity/narrative evidence for actions and message direction |

## Ordered activities and source narrative

**P356** The account servicer announces a mandatory with election or a voluntary event. A CA Movement Preliminary Advice is sent to the account owner after receipt of its corporate action instruction.

Source diagram evidence: [fig-0040](../documents/src-000079/diagrams/fig-0040.md). Mermaid reconstruction and visual review are pending.

## Messages and alternative paths

Source-supported message family mentions: `seev.033`. Full versions are retained only when explicitly present: none established in this segment.

Optional, failure, cancellation, reversal and decision paths remain as described in the source narrative and activity rows above. No additional path is inferred from message names or XML containment.

## Limitations and provenance

- Focused flow curation is recorded in linked diagram and narrative evidence; table review remains independent of diagram review.
- Message family mentions do not identify an exact supplied schema version unless the full identifier is stated.
- Participants listed from narrative mentions are not automatically senders, receivers, or responsible actors.

## Curated source routing scenario

Formal preconditions/postconditions beyond the scenario narrative are not supplied. [Complete source reconstruction](../diagrams/routing-scenarios/fig-0040.md).

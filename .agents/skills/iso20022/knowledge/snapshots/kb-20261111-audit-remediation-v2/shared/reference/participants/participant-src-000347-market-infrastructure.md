# Market Infrastructure

Business context: T2S Billing. Source classification: business role.

## Definition

The party that provides, through common membership, services to create a fair and open process for the execution of transactions between trading parties, and the creation of settlement obligations. Example include an exchange.

Evidence: [T6](../../../domains/securities/reference/message-sets/t2s-billing/december-2025/documents/src-000347/tables/tbl-0006.md), source row 7.

A functional participant role describes involvement in a relationship or transaction. It is not an assertion that a particular institution always plays that role.

## Responsibilities and actions

Responsibilities are described in the definition and linked flows; no separate activity-initiator rows were matched.

## Relationships

| Relationship | Related scoped record | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Can play the functional participant role in this source context | [Account Owner](participant-src-000347-account-owner.md) | [T7](../../../domains/securities/reference/message-sets/t2s-billing/december-2025/documents/src-000347/tables/tbl-0007.md) row 6, column 3 |

## Flows, source process sections and messages

No flow segment has yet been matched to this role label.

Message families found in these flows: not established. Exact-version applicability requires the linked source locator.

## Aliases, identification and limitations

Source labels: `Market Infrastructure`. No external identifier scheme or alias equivalence has been inferred.

- Definition is scoped to this source and message-set context; same labels in other sources remain distinct.
- Aliases and identifier schemes have not been established beyond explicit source labels.
- Narrative-only participants not captured by definition/initiator tables require additional review.

Billing source context: [Billing business roles and functional participants](../../../domains/securities/reference/message-sets/t2s-billing/december-2025/diagrams/curated/fig-0001.md). Source role-matrix inconsistency remains open under issue-000038.

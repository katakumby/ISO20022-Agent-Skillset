# Tripartite Central Matching Without Confirmation Distribution Service

Source context: Post-Trade Matching. This reference preserves the source-defined segment and its evidence.

This source-defined scenario begins with the first confirmation exchange below. Its purpose, conditional agreement/rejection, cancellation alternatives and outcomes are specified by the source narrative. No additional formal preconditions or postconditions are invented. [Related activity process](flow-src-000180-p173-tripartite-central-matching-without-confirmation-distribution-service.md) provides the broader activity context.

## Participants

| Source role | Canonical scoped record | Evidence interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Investment Manager | [Participant](../../../../../../../shared/reference/participants/participant-src-000180-investment-manager.md) | Mentioned in this segment; use the activity/narrative evidence for actions and message direction |
| Broker | [Participant](../../../../../../../shared/reference/participants/participant-src-000180-broker.md) | Mentioned in this segment; use the activity/narrative evidence for actions and message direction |

## Ordered activities and source narrative

**P233** The executing broker sends a trade confirmation to the CMU. The CMU advise both parties that the trade confirmation is not paired yet. The investment manager sends the corresponding trade confirmation to the CMU. The CMU performs a matching process between the two confirmations and sends matching status messages to both parties, reflecting the outcome of the matching process. The CMU will forward the confirmation received from both the executing broker and investment manager to the trustee. If the trustee agrees with the details of the confirmations, it may send an affirmation message to the CMU. The message will bind the parties to the trade details of the confirmation being affirmed. Upon receipt of the affirmation message, the CMU will send an affirmation status message to the executing broker and the trade may move into the settlement process.

Source diagram evidence: [fig-0022](../documents/src-000180/diagrams/fig-0022.md). The reconstructed sequence and actual review evidence are linked below.

## Messages and alternative paths

Optional, failure, cancellation, reversal and decision paths remain as described in the source narrative and activity rows above. No additional path is inferred from message names or XML containment.

## Limitations and provenance

- Focused flow curation is recorded in linked diagram and narrative evidence; table review remains independent of diagram review.
- Message family mentions do not identify an exact supplied schema version unless the full identifier is stated.
- Participants listed from narrative mentions are not automatically senders, receivers, or responsible actors.

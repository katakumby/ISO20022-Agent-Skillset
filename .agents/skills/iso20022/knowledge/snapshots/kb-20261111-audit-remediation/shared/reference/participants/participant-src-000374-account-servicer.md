# Account Servicer

Party managing the account on behalf of the account owner: registration and booking of entries, balance calculation and account information. This is optional in the position response (P173-P174), mandatory and non-repetitive in the penalties report (P193-P194). It is not automatically equated with a named institution or with every technical sender.

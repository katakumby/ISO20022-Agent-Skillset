# Settlement Infrastructure

Business context: T2S CollateralReporting. Source classification: business role.

## Definition

The party that provides services to its members for the settlement of transactions and holding of assets (e. g.  T2S, RTGS).

Evidence: [T6](../../../domains/securities/reference/message-sets/t2s-collateral-reporting/march-2024/documents/src-000356/tables/tbl-0006.md), source row 4.

A functional participant role describes involvement in a relationship or transaction. It is not an assertion that a particular institution always plays that role.

## Responsibilities and actions

Responsibilities are described in the definition and linked flows; no separate activity-initiator rows were matched.

## Relationships

| Relationship | Related scoped record | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Can play the functional participant role in this source context | [System Transaction Administrator](participant-src-000356-system-transaction-administrator.md) | [T7](../../../domains/securities/reference/message-sets/t2s-collateral-reporting/march-2024/documents/src-000356/tables/tbl-0007.md) row 5, column 3 |

## Flows, source process sections and messages

| Flow | Participation evidence |

| [Query Management Process](../../../domains/securities/reference/message-sets/t2s-collateral-reporting/march-2024/flows/flow-src-000356-p138-query-management-process.md) | Role label occurs in this source segment. Responsibilities/direction remain those explicitly stated in the evidence. |

Message families found in these flows: `colr.001`. Exact-version applicability requires the linked source locator.

## Aliases, identification and limitations

Source labels: `Settlement Infrastructure`. No external identifier scheme or alias equivalence has been inferred.

- Definition is scoped to this source and message-set context; same labels in other sources remain distinct.
- Aliases and identifier schemes have not been established beyond explicit source labels.
- Narrative-only participants not captured by definition/initiator tables require additional review.

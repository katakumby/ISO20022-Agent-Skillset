• SafekeepingPlaceType/SharesHeldAtICSD: an ICSD's BIC will be used for ICSD internal, ICSD/
local and ICSD to ICSD settlement instructions.
• SafekeepingPlaceType/SharesHeldAtLoaclCustodian: applicable, for instance, when the account
servicer is a global custodian and provides the account owner with a position reporting at global
custodian's agents' level. When instructing, the fund manager would therefore mention, as a place of
safekeeping, the BIC of the global custodian's agent on the market.
Absence of SafekeepingPlace means that:
• The SafekeepingPlace information is kept by the account servicer (SLA, account structure, ETC.)
and should not be provided by the account owner.
• The SafekeepingPlace is the counterparty's Depository. The transaction is therefore domestic (to
an NCSD) or internal to an ICSD.
For more details, see the relevant market practice document on www.smpg.info.
• SafekeepingPlaceRule
The SafekeepingPlace functionality in the settlement instructions is only to be used for global
custodians that allow their clients to specify where the securities are to be held, for example, in an
ICSD account versus an account at the local CSD.

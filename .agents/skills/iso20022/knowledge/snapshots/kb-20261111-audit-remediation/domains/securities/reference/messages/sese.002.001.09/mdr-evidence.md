**src-000096, 25 sese.002.001.09 TransferOutCancellationRequestV09, Functionality, file p513.**

Scope
The TransferOutCancellationRequest message is sent by an instructing party, for example, an
investment manager or its authorised representative, to the executing party, for example, a transfer
agent, to request the cancellation of a previously sent transfer out instruction.
Usage
The TransferOutCancellationRequest message is used to request the cancellation of one or more
transfer out instructions.
There is no amendment, but a cancellation and re-instruct policy.
To request the cancellation of one or more transfer out instructions, the transfer reference of the
transfer, as specified in the original TransferOutInstruction message, is specified in the transfer
reference element.
The message identification of the original TransferOutInstruction message may also be quoted in
PreviousReference but this is not recommended.
The deadline and acceptance of a cancellation request is subject to a service level agreement (SLA).
This cancellation message is a cancellation request. There is no automatic acceptance of the
cancellation.
The rejection or acceptance of a TransferOutCancellationRequest is made using a
TransferCancellationStatusReport message.
